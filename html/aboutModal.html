    <h3 class="bg-primary">About</h3>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Colorado Division of Oil & Public Safety's Web Mapping Application. The Petroleum Program within the Division is responsible for protecting human health and the environment
        from petroleum releases caused by regulated storage tank systems. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        This includes oversight of assessment and clean up of regulated substances from both underground storage tank (UST) and aboveground storage tank (AST) systems.  This application
        provides geospatial information about petroleum releases (or "events") reported to the Division of Oil & Public Safety. There are two types of release events that are mapped in this application:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Open Event:</b> Any release event that is currently being investigated, assessed, remediated, or obtaining closure.
                This includes:  Assessment, Site Characterization Report (SCR) Complete, Implementing a Corrective Action Plan (CAP),
                Enforcement, Brownfield, and also State Lead/LUST Trust clean up efforts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Closed Event:</b> Any release event that has been issued a No Further Action determination
                based on the risk of exposure to any remaining contamination via the exposure pathways. The State of Colorado uses a four-tiered closure criteria approach for petroleum releases.
                A petroleum release may be reopened if exposure conditions change.
            </li>
        </ul>
